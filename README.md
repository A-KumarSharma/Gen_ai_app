Candidate Platforms for Gen AI app 

# Customer Task 
Attached is a compiled list of Candidate Platforms for Gen AI app for low or no cost pulled together by my friends. I need this to deploy a simple Gen AI App with the following components:

a) Simple UI to allow users to select a Country, select Regulation (e.g., FDA) and enter a question (so in all 2 drop-downs and a text field)

b) Gen AI app (LLM and agentic AI) that gets answers to questions from Regulations stored on server (these will be max 1-2 GB)

c) Solution will also attempt to go out to FDA and other websites so need to have internet access to perform web query against FDA website. Note that, If needed, the web content could be loaded onto the server.
